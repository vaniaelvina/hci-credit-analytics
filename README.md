### Project Background
Home Credit is an international consumer finance provider focusing on responsible lending. Currently, Home Credit is utilizing various statistical and machine learning methods to predict credit scores. In this project, we want to ensure that customers capable of repaying loans are not rejected when applying for one, and loans can be provided with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will motivate customers to succeed.

### Objectives
1. Identify characteristics of potential clients who may have/not have payment difficulties.
2. Forecast clients' ability to meet repayment obligations.
3. Suggest business recommendation based on the findings.
